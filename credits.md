# Credits

This course is based on:
- a previous version of this class taught by **Michelle Ichinco** at UMass Lowell (whose course was adapted from Caitlin Kelleher at Washington University in St. Louis), and
- the User-Centered Research and Evaluation course designed and taught by **Raelin Musuraca** and **Motahhare Eslami** at Carnegie Mellon University.
  
Additionally, syllabus language and assignments are modified from materials prepared by **Jill Drury** and **Geoff Kaufman**.

- Laura Dabbish
- Chinmay Kulkarni 
- Qian Yang
- Jodi Forlizzi
- John Zimmerman
