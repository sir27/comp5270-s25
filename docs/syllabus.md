## Welcome!

I’m happy to have you in the class and excited to explore HCI with you. This syllabus contains information about the content of this class, classroom policies and norms, assignments, grading, our schedule, and university policies. It is a long document. Please read the whole thing. This information is important, and becoming familiar with it is a good use of your time.

## Course description

The purpose of this class is to ground students in the basics of how humans interact with technology, and make students aware of the breadth of topic areas related to human-computer interaction (HCI). This course covers theoretical constructs such as the Model-Human Processor, and includes seminal readings by the original researchers. The course places a large emphasis on techniques for understanding users' tasks, formulating users' requirements, and assessing proposed designs using heuristic evaluation and other methods. As part of understanding users' needs, students will consider social, organizational, and ethical perspectives on human-computer interaction. <!--Students are also exposed to specialty topics in human-computer interaction such as universal access and intelligent interfaces.--> This course includes a project to design, develop, document, and orally present a prototype interface. At the end of the course students will be able to cite basic principles of human interaction and devise and carry out a usability engineering plan to aid in developing new interfaces.

## Course learning outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will demonstrate the ability to:

1. Apply user-centered design processes in the ideation and implementation of novel systems
<!--2. Critically evaluate the quality of user information based on collection methodology.-->
2. Develop and refine designs for new software systems that consider usability concerns from the outset.
3. Compare the strengths and weaknesses of different HCI techniques for a given design problem.
4. Discuss open challenges in the field of human-computer interaction, including ethical, social, and policy implications of new designs.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this course. Students are expected to have proficiency with computers. Programming and graphic design skills may be helpful, but are not required.

## Diversity and inclusion statement

The people in this class and in our UMass Lowell community come from diverse identities and backgrounds. Diversity includes a variety of dimensions, such as race, gender identity, ethnicity, sexual orientation, faith and non-faith perspectives, and many others. In this class, we will study ways in which system design can both support and exclude users along these dimensions. We must also be cognizant and respectful of identity—including dimensions not explicitly mentioned in this statement—when we design course materials, deliver course content, and interact with each other. It is my goal to make this class as accessible, approachable, and useful for all students as it can possibly be. If you have suggestions about how to better align the course with the values of diversity and inclusion, I encourage you to share them with me.

## Assessments

Your final grade will be based on the following components:

| Component            | Individual or group                                 | Percentage |
| :------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| Participation        | Individual                                          | 5%         |
| Homework assignments | Individual                                          | 15%        |
| Midterm              | Individual                                          | 30%        |
| Final project        | Group (with an individually-graded teamwork survey) | 50%        |
| **Total**            | **Individual**                                      | **100%**   |

Letter grades will be assigned based on the number of points you earn (out of 100):

| Letter grade | Range  |
| :----------- | :----- |
| A+           | 97-100 |
| A            | 93-96  |
| A-           | 90-92  |
| B+           | 87-89  |
| B            | 83-86  |
| B-           | 80-82  |
| C+           | 77-79  |
| C            | 70-76  |
| F            | <70    |

### Participation

Regular class attendance will be very much to your advantage. There will be material presented in class that is NOT included in the readings; you will only be able to obtain it by attending class. Also, there will be in-class exercises that will help you to understand and practice various techniques. Some of the midterm questions may be drawn from the in-class exercises. Finally, this class will incorporate a number of class discussions and chances to learn from fellow students. You will be expected to participate in discussions and exercises during class.

Once the final project kicks off, please tell your teammates if you’ll be absent from class so that they can prepare appropriately for work sessions and other activities that we/they might be planning to do during class time. If you are sick, please take care of yourself, and do not come to class.

Opportunities to participate outside of the class meetings themselves -- e.g., sharing observations/links related to the class in forums, attending lectures related to the class -- will likely arise throughout the semester, so keep an eye out for those.

### Homework assignments

There will be a handful of individual homework assignments throughout the semester. These assignments will allow you to practice core user-centered research skills such as wireframing, heuristic evaluation, and UI critiques prior to starting the group project. There will be an individual reflection homework assignment toward the end of the course. There will be a student survey at the beginning of the course, which will be graded for completion as part of the overall assignment grade.

### Midterm

The midterm will be given in class. It will focus on everything we’ve covered up to that point. There will be multiple choice “right or wrong” answers that assess your knowledge of the technical content covered in lectures and readings as well as open-ended questions that allow you to apply what you’ve learned.

### Final project

For your final project, you will design a prototype interface to address one or multiple needs of a user group. This will give you an opportunity to apply the principles of HCI and user research techniques to a specific application area. Interim deliverables, completed with your final project teammates, will be the building blocks for your final project. You will work in teams of 3-4 for this project.

The prototype should take into account the principles of HCI as well as your findings from the formative research activities you conduct for the interim deliverables. You must document how your final design incorporates knowledge from the class and from your formative research activities. The prototype does not have to be fully functional, but it needs to be interactive enough to convey the interface design to others. You may use prototyping methods and tools of your choice.

The project will be evaluated primarily based upon (1) the degree to which the interface effectively takes into account the principles of HCI and findings from your formative research activities (interim deliverables) and (2) how well the interface conveys the design. Clear articulation of your thought process, both in writing and verbally, is a crucial aspect of designing for and engaging with end users and clients. Therefore, clarity of expression will also factor into the assessment of all written and presented project components. A more detailed rubric will be available in the final project description documentation. The breakdown of the grading for the final project is as follows:

| Component            | Points |
| :------------------- | :----- |
| Interim deliverables | 20     |
| Final report         | 15     |
| Final presentation   | 10     |
| Teammate assessment  | 5      |
| **Total**            | **50** |

By default, all members of a group will receive the same grade on the interim deliverables, final report, and final presentation portions of the project (worth 45 points, or 90% of the project grade, all together). The teammate survey will be graded individually and used in determining how many of the remaining 5 points (10% of the project grade) each person will receive. I reserve the right to further adjust individual project grades in extreme cases, i.e., if there is a consensus among teammates that a group member went truly above and beyond or that someone really did not pull their weight. More details about the project will be available shortly after the start of the semester.

## Course policies

### Academic integrity

All students are advised that there is a [University policy regarding academic integrity](https://www.uml.edu/catalog/undergraduate/policies/academic-policies/academic-integrity.aspx). Students are responsible for the honest completion and representation of their work. All work submitted must be your own. Submitting work that you did not produce and claiming that it is your own is plagiarism and is subject to disciplinary action according to UML’s policy.

### Generative AI

For most of the work you will do for this class, there is no right answer. I want to **see work that is authentically yours**, not work that is “right”.

In this class, you may use generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini) to help you create authentic work. You can use it to:

1. copy edit or make other minor improvements to work that you yourself have already done, or
2. generate images that you want to use for illustrative purposes.

You must always cite your sources; this includes generative AI tools. You do not have to disclose the use of tools that can only make grammatical edits and small rephrasing suggestions (e.g., spellcheck in Microsoft Word).

Any time you use copy-paste into or from a generative AI tool, you need to explain what you copied and/or what you pasted, and why. I will not penalize you for permitted uses of AI. When in doubt, disclose: it is better to over-cite and over-explain than to under-explain and risk violating academic integrity.

Examples of citations and usage statements that reflect permitted use of AI are:

- “I used ChatGPT to edit my grammar on this assignment. I pasted in my completed report, asked it to fix technical issues with the English, and pasted the corrected output into my assignment.”
- “This image was generated by DALL-E.”

Use of generative AI that does not follow these guidelines will count as a violation of academic integrity. If you copy-paste auto generated text into your coursework in which the AI has contributed more than minor technical edits, it will be both plagiarism and very obvious to me.

### Recordings

Class meetings will be recorded using Echo360 and posted to Blackboard. If you miss class, please review the recording. Do not attempt to download the recordings; this is a violation of university privacy policy. If you have trouble accessing a recording, let me know. Watching recordings are not a substitute for coming to class.

### Late submissions

All assignments are due at 11:59pm Eastern Time on the day of the deadline unless otherwise specified. Deadlines in this course are structured to teach and reinforce specific concepts at specific times, help you make gradual and iterative progress on your final project, and balance out my grading load. I expect you to turn all of your work in on time, and it’s in your best interests to do so. If there are circumstances that prevent you from being able to turn in an assignment on time, contact me as soon as possible.

### Regrades

I will review regrade requests if you think I’ve made a mistake. If you ask me to regrade your work, please provide an explanation of what is problematic about the grading and what you believe should be changed.

### Email

Email is the best way to reach me. I try to turn emails around in 2 business days or less. If you haven’t heard back from me, or if it’s really urgent, feel free to nudge the message. I often handle emails in bulk and/or during non-business hours. If you receive an email from me late at night or during a weekend or holiday, please don’t see it as an obligation to respond right away. Please do not try to contact me via Microsoft Teams.

### Office hours

Office hours are a great opportunity to discuss questions you have about the class, consult with me about your final project, and ask clarification questions about feedback I have given you on assignments. Office hours will run from Thursday, January 25th through Thursday, April 25th. There will be no office hours during spring break. If I am out of town and/or class is canceled on a day when the class usually meets, assume office hours are canceled that day too.

### Devices

You are welcome to use computers, phones, tablets, etc. in this class to support your learning.

### Food, drink, and masks

I ask that students avoid eating in class to the greatest extent possible. If you need to eat during class, please try to keep it as quick and unobtrusive as you can. We follow university guidelines on masking. Regardless of such guidelines, students are always welcome to wear a mask in this class if they choose to do so. I ask that you all respect each other’s choices regarding masking. In order to make this class as inclusive as possible, I reserve the right to change this policy at any time based on new information related to student accommodations and needs.

### Credit hour policy

Federal definition of a credit hour requires that for every course credit awarded, a course must offer 15 hours of instructor-led course activities and 30 hours of out-of-class student work. This means that a standard 3 credit hour course requires 45 hours of instructor-led course activities and 90 hours of out-of-class student work.

### University privacy statement

UMass Lowell recognizes the importance of mutual trust between students and faculty. Massachusetts is a two-party consent state, which means it is illegal to record someone without their permission. Recordings of classroom lectures are the intellectual property of the instructor. Instructors have the right to prohibit audio and video recording of their lectures, unless the requesting student is registered with Disabilities Services and recording of class sessions is an approved accommodation. In addition, sharing or selling recordings of classroom activities, discussions or lectures with any other person or medium without permission of the instructor is prohibited.

### Campus closures

In the event that campus is closed (snow day, power outage, etc.) on a day when class meets, please check your email in the morning for an update from me. Based on my assessment of the best way to proceed under the specific circumstances of the campus closure and our progression through the class, I may hold a virtual class, cancel class, or share a recorded lecture with you.
